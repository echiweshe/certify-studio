feat: establish Certify Studio foundation with enterprise architecture

This commit establishes the complete foundation for Certify Studio, an
AI-powered certification content generation platform that democratizes
technical education through automated, high-quality training materials.

Key Components Implemented:
- Enterprise-grade project structure following clean architecture
- FastAPI backend with async support and modular design
- Multi-agent AI orchestration framework for content generation
- Enhanced Manim extensions for cloud provider animations
- Comprehensive documentation including vision and architecture
- Production-ready configuration with environment management
- Database layer with SQLAlchemy and async PostgreSQL support
- Observability with structured logging and metrics
- API versioning and OpenAPI documentation
- Health checks and graceful degradation

Architecture Highlights:
- Microservices-ready modular design
- Multi-agent consensus validation for quality assurance
- Provider-specific themes (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes)
- Accessibility-first approach (WCAG 2.1 AA target)
- Multi-format export pipeline (Video, PPT, Web, 3D)

Documentation:
- Vision document outlining mission and impact goals
- Detailed architecture documentation
- Comprehensive continuation guide for future development
- Contributing guidelines and code standards
- Quick start guide for developers

Technical Stack:
- Python 3.11+ with type hints throughout
- FastAPI for high-performance async API
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async support
- Manim for programmatic animations
- LangChain ready for AI agent implementation
- Docker and Kubernetes ready deployment

This foundation provides a solid base for building a platform that will
revolutionize how technical certifications are taught, making quality
education accessible to everyone regardless of geography or economics.

Next Steps:
- Implement core AI agents for content extraction
- Build out Manim animation patterns
- Create React frontend
- Add authentication and user management
- Implement export pipeline

The project is structured to support rapid development while maintaining
enterprise-grade quality standards. All code follows best practices with
comprehensive error handling, logging, and documentation.
