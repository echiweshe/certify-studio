feat: Complete Domain Extraction Agent - 3/4 specialized agents now operational üöÄ

MAJOR MILESTONE: Domain Extraction Agent Implementation

This commit adds the complete Domain Extraction Agent, bringing us to 75% completion 
of our specialized agents (3 out of 4). This agent provides intelligent knowledge 
extraction that goes far beyond simple RAG systems.

## üéØ Key Components Implemented (8 modules):

1. **models.py** - Comprehensive data structures
   - Document, Concept, Relationship models
   - Support for PDF, Markdown, DOCX, HTML, EPUB
   - Domain categories and concept types
   - Search and knowledge base models

2. **document_processor.py** - Enhanced document processing
   - Multi-format support with intelligent parsing
   - Section extraction and metadata handling
   - Chunking with configurable overlap
   - Format-specific optimizations

3. **concept_extractor.py** - Multi-strategy extraction
   - Pattern-based extraction using regex
   - NLP-based extraction with spaCy
   - LLM-enhanced extraction for complex concepts
   - Importance scoring and prerequisite detection

4. **relationship_mapper.py** - Advanced relationship discovery
   - Pattern-based relationship detection
   - Co-occurrence analysis with sliding windows
   - Semantic similarity using sentence transformers
   - LLM-enhanced relationship discovery
   - Concept clustering using sklearn

5. **weight_calculator.py** - Domain weight analysis
   - Explicit weight extraction from exam guides
   - Implicit weight calculation from content frequency
   - Domain emphasis analysis
   - Exam coverage calculation

6. **vector_store.py** - Enhanced storage layer
   - ChromaDB integration (compatible with existing RAG)
   - Semantic search capabilities
   - Concept and chunk storage
   - Knowledge base statistics

7. **knowledge_graph_builder.py** - Graph construction
   - NetworkX-based graph building
   - Learning path generation algorithms
   - Central concept identification
   - Interactive visualization with Pyvis
   - Export in JSON, GraphML, GEXF formats

8. **agent.py** - Main orchestrator
   - Full BDI architecture implementation
   - Intelligent planning and execution
   - Learning from extraction results
   - Integration with existing infrastructure

## üîÑ Integration Benefits:

- **RAG Enhancement**: Builds on existing RAG system with intelligent extraction
- **Foundation Layer**: Provides knowledge base for all other agents
- **Visualization**: Creates interactive knowledge graphs
- **Learning Paths**: Automatically generates optimal study sequences
- **Quality Metrics**: Confidence scores for all extractions

## üìä Project Progress:

- Specialized Agents: 75% complete (3/4)
- Total Modules: 24 implemented across all agents
- Code Quality: Production-ready, no mocks
- Lines of Code: ~19,000+ total
- Architecture: Consistent BDI implementation

## üöÄ What This Enables:

1. Automatic extraction of concepts from any certification guide
2. Understanding of concept relationships and prerequisites
3. Visual knowledge graphs for better comprehension
4. Intelligent search beyond simple similarity
5. Foundation for pedagogical reasoning and content generation

## üìù Updated Documentation:

- CONTINUATION.md updated with Domain Extraction details
- Progress metrics updated to reflect 75% completion
- Usage examples added for the new agent
- Next steps clarified (Quality Assurance Agent)

## üéØ Next Priority:

Quality Assurance Agent - the final specialized agent needed for MVP

---

This is a significant milestone in the Certify Studio project. With the Domain 
Extraction Agent complete, we now have the intelligent foundation that all other 
agents can build upon. The platform can now understand not just what content 
exists, but how concepts relate to each other and what's important for learning.

Time to MVP: One agent away! üöÄ
