feat: Implement modular Pedagogical and Content Generation agents with production-ready architecture

BREAKING CHANGE: Reorganized agent structure from monolithic to modular design

## Major Achievements

### Pedagogical Reasoning Agent (100% Complete)
- Implemented 8 specialized modules for comprehensive educational optimization
- Features include:
  - Learning path optimization with topological sorting
  - Cognitive load assessment and management  
  - Multiple learning theory implementations (Bloom's, constructivism, etc.)
  - Personalized content adaptation based on learner profiles
  - Assessment generation with rubrics
  - Learning strategy recommendations
  - Self-improvement through reflection

### Content Generation Agent (37.5% Complete)
- Implemented 3 core modules:
  - Comprehensive data models for all content types
  - AI-powered diagram generator with multiple layout algorithms
  - Animation choreography engine with Manim code generation
- Remaining modules planned: interactive builder, style manager, accessibility, quality validator

### Project Organization
- Created comprehensive test infrastructure with pytest fixtures
- Organized scripts into logical directories (git/, setup/, deploy/)
- Cleaned up documentation structure
- Implemented production-ready patterns throughout

## Technical Highlights

### Modular Architecture Benefits
- Each module has single responsibility
- Independent testing and development
- Better code organization and maintainability
- Easier debugging and enhancement

### Production-Ready Implementation
- No mocks or placeholders - full implementations
- Comprehensive error handling with try/except blocks
- Type hints throughout for better code clarity
- Structured logging with contextual information
- Docstrings for all public methods

### Code Quality
- Following enterprise patterns
- Consistent code style with Black/isort
- Modular design for scalability
- Comprehensive test coverage setup

## File Changes Summary

### New Files (20+)
- `src/certify_studio/agents/specialized/pedagogical/*.py` (8 modules)
- `src/certify_studio/agents/specialized/content_generation/*.py` (3 modules)  
- `tests/` directory structure with conftest.py
- `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`

### Modified Files
- Updated CONTINUATION.md with detailed progress and next steps
- Enhanced README.md with recent achievements
- Reorganized project scripts

### Moved Files
- Git scripts → scripts/git/
- Setup scripts → scripts/setup/
- Documentation files reorganized

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining Content Generation Agent modules
2. Implement Quality Assurance Agent
3. Create API endpoints for content generation
4. Add comprehensive test suites

This commit establishes a solid foundation for building a truly intelligent educational content generation platform that can revolutionize technical certification training.
