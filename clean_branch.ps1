git commit -m "feat: Implement truly autonomous multi-agent system with BDI architecture

## ðŸ¤– Major Architecture Implementation

### Core Agent Framework
- Implemented AutonomousAgent base class with BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) architecture
- Multi-level memory system: short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic, and procedural
- Complete cognitive cycle: Perceive â†’ Think â†’ Plan â†’ Act â†’ Reflect â†’ Collaborate
- Agent states, capabilities, goals, and beliefs management

### Reasoning Engine
- Multiple reasoning types: deductive, inductive, causal, analogical
- Knowledge graph integration with NetworkX
- Inference rules and causal models
- Pedagogical reasoning for educational content optimization
- Concept extraction and relationship inference

### Self-Improvement System
- Performance tracking with multiple metrics
- A/B testing framework for strategy experimentation
- Adaptive behavior modification based on results
- Learning from feedback and experience
- Automatic model retraining pipeline

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Modular collaboration system with 6 protocols:
  - Hierarchical: Leader-follower structure
  - Peer-to-Peer: Equal agent collaboration
  - Blackboard: Shared problem-solving space
  - Contract Net: Task bidding and allocation
  - Swarm: Emergent collective intelligence
  - Consensus: Group decision making
- Inter-agent messaging system
- Shared workspaces with locking mechanisms
- Task decomposition and allocation
- Consensus building for quality assurance

### Documentation Updates
- Updated CONTINUATION.md with agentic implementation details
- Enhanced architecture documentation with agent details
- Added comprehensive agentic-architecture.md
- Updated VISION.md with multimodal and agentic capabilities

### Technical Implementation
- src/certify_studio/agents/core/
  - autonomous_agent.py: Base agent class
  - reasoning_engine.py: Multi-type reasoning
  - self_improvement.py: Learning mechanisms
  - collaboration/: Modular collaboration system
    - protocols.py: Protocol definitions
    - messages.py: Messaging system
    - tasks.py: Task management
    - workspace.py: Shared workspaces
    - consensus.py: Consensus mechanisms
    - system.py: Main orchestrator
    - protocols_impl/: Protocol handlers

This implementation provides:
- True agent autonomy with independent decision-making
- Continuous self-improvement through experimentation
- Sophisticated multi-agent collaboration
- Scalable and extensible architecture
- Foundation for intelligent educational content generation"
