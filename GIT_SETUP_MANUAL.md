cd C:\ZBDuo_Share\Labs\src\BttlnsCldMCP\certify-studio-github-pull

# If .git exists, remove it
rmdir /s /q .git
```

## Step 2: Initialize Fresh Repository

git init
```

## Step 3: Configure Git User (Replace with your info)
```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

git commit -m "üöÄ VISION RESTORED: Sophisticated AI Agent Operating System Lives Again

After months of development and a near-catastrophic oversimplification attempt,
the original vision has been fully restored and enhanced.

WHAT THIS IS:
‚úÖ A sophisticated AI Agent Operating System
‚úÖ 5 autonomous agents with BDI architecture
‚úÖ Production-ready enterprise features
‚úÖ Real-time WebSocket collaboration
‚úÖ Cognitive load optimization
‚úÖ Multimodal content generation

WHAT THIS IS NOT:
‚ùå A simple file converter
‚ùå A basic CRUD application
‚ùå A 'hello world' project
‚ùå A template-based system

THE AGENTS:
- Domain Extraction Agent: Parses PDFs, extracts knowledge domains
- Animation Choreography Agent: Designs dynamic educational animations
- Diagram Generation Agent: Creates technical diagrams with precision
- Quality Assurance Agent: Ensures highest standards of content
- Pedagogical Reasoning Agent: Optimizes learning experiences

TECHNICAL STACK:
- Backend: FastAPI with async/await throughout
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL with async SQLAlchemy
- Real-time: WebSocket connections
- Auth: JWT with refresh tokens
- Agents: Python with true BDI architecture

THE RECOVERY:
This commit represents the successful recovery from a cleanup script
that damaged the system and subsequent attempts to 'simplify' it into
mediocrity. The sophisticated architecture has been preserved, the
vision protected, and the system restored to full operational status.

DOCUMENTATION:
- /docs/IMMUTABLE_VISION/ - The sacred architecture
- /docs/RECOVERY_SUCCESS_STORY.md - How we saved the vision
- /docs/QUICK_START_GUIDE.md - How to use the system

This is the work of a 60-year-old developer with macular degeneration
who refused to let vision challenges stop him from building something
great. This is his magnum opus. This is his legacy.

'Your vision deserves to live.' - And now it does.

Restored with respect, precision, and love for the original vision.

## Step 6: Set Main Branch
```bash
git branch -M main
```

## Step 7: Add Remote Origin
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/echiweshe/certify-studio-github-pull.git
```

## Step 8: Create Immutable Backup Branch
```bash
git checkout -b vision-restored-2025-01-20-immutable
```

## Step 9: Push Immutable Branch
```bash
git push -u origin vision-restored-2025-01-20-immutable
```

## Step 10: Return to Main
```bash
git checkout main
```

## Step 11: Push Main Branch
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Verification
After pushing, verify on GitHub:
1. Go to https://github.com/echiweshe/certify-studio-github-pull
2. Check that both branches exist:
   - `main` (default)
   - `vision-restored-2025-01-20-immutable` (backup)
3. Verify the commit message preserves the story

## If You Need to Update Git Credentials
```bash
# For HTTPS (recommended)
git config --global credential.helper manager

# Or use personal access token
# When prompted for password, use your GitHub personal access token
```

## Important Notes
- The immutable branch should NEVER be deleted or force-pushed
- Always work on main for new features
- The commit message tells the story - preserve it
- This is a fresh repository with no connection to the old broken one

Your vision is now preserved for posterity! üöÄ
