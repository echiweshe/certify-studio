   - Comprehensive data structures for documents, concepts, relationships
   - Support for multiple document types (PDF, Markdown, DOCX, HTML, EPUB)
   - Domain categories and concept types
   - Search and knowledge base models

2. **Document Processor** (`document_processor.py`)

   - Intelligent chunking with overlap
   - Section extraction and metadata handling

3. **Concept Extractor** (`concept_extractor.py`)

   - Semantic similarity using sentence transformers
   - LLM-enhanced relationship discovery
   - Concept clustering

5. **Weight Calculator** (`weight_calculator.py`)
   - Explicit weight extraction from exam guides
   - Implicit weight calculation from content
   - Domain emphasis analysis
   - Exam coverage calculation

6. **Vector Store** (`vector_store.py`)
   - ChromaDB integration (compatible with existing system)
   - Semantic search capabilities
   - Concept and chunk storage
   - Knowledge base statistics

7. **Knowledge Graph Builder** (`knowledge_graph_builder.py`)
   - NetworkX-based graph construction
   - Learning path generation
   - Central concept identification
   - Interactive visualization with Pyvis
   - Graph export in multiple formats

8. **Domain Extraction Agent** (`agent.py`)
   - Full BDI architecture implementation
   - Orchestrates all modules
   - Plans and executes extraction
   - Learns from results
   - Compatible with existing RAG infrastructure

**🔄 Integration with RAG System:**
- Reuses document processing pipeline but enhances it
- Compatible with ChromaDB vector storage
- Maintains embedding approach with OpenAI
- Extends beyond simple RAG to intelligent knowledge extraction

**🚀 Enhanced Capabilities:**
- **Intelligent Concept Extraction** - Not just chunking, but understanding
- **Relationship Discovery** - Maps how concepts connect
- **Knowledge Graph** - Visual representation of domain knowledge
- **Learning Paths** - Automatically generated from concept relationships
- **Domain Weights** - Understands exam emphasis
- **Quality Metrics** - Confidence scores for extractions

**📊 Usage Example:**
```python
# Initialize the agent
agent = DomainExtractionAgent()
await agent.initialize()

# Create extraction request
request = ExtractionRequest(
    document_paths=["path/to/aws-cert-guide.pdf"],
    domain_name="AWS Solutions Architect",
    certification_name="AWS-SAA-C03",
    chunk_size=500,
    chunk_overlap=50
)

# Extract domain knowledge
result = await agent.extract_domain_knowledge(request)

# Access extracted knowledge
if result.success:
    knowledge = result.domain_knowledge
    print(f"Extracted {knowledge.total_concepts} concepts")
    print(f"Found {knowledge.total_relationships} relationships")
    
    # Search for concepts
    search_results = await agent.search_knowledge(
        SearchQuery(query="EC2 instances", max_results=5)
    )
    
    # Export knowledge graph
    graph_json = await agent.export_knowledge_graph(format="json")
```

**🍨 Key Advantages Over Simple RAG:**
- **Structured Knowledge** - Not just text chunks, but concepts and relationships
- **Domain Understanding** - Knows what's important for certification
- **Learning Path Generation** - Can suggest study sequences
- **Visual Knowledge Graph** - See how concepts connect
- **Intelligent Search** - Beyond similarity, understands concept importance
