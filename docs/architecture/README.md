## ü§ñ Agentic Architecture Details

### Agent Cognitive Cycle
```
1. Perceive: Gather observations from environment
2. Think: Analyze situation, update beliefs, generate intentions
3. Plan: Create actionable plans to achieve goals
4. Act: Execute plans in the environment
5. Reflect: Learn from outcomes, update strategies
6. Collaborate: Work with other agents when needed
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocols

#### Hierarchical Protocol
- One agent acts as leader, others as followers
- Leader decomposes tasks and delegates
- Followers report results back to leader
- Best for: Well-structured tasks with clear subtasks

#### Peer-to-Peer Protocol
- All agents work as equals
- Shared workspace for coordination
- Distributed decision making
- Best for: Creative tasks requiring diverse perspectives

#### Blackboard Protocol
- Agents contribute to shared problem space
- Opportunistic problem solving
- No central coordination
- Best for: Complex problems with unknown solution paths

#### Contract Net Protocol
- Tasks announced to all agents
- Agents bid based on capabilities
- Best bidder wins contract
- Best for: Dynamic task allocation

#### Swarm Protocol
- Simple rules lead to emergent behavior
- Agents leave pheromone trails
- Collective intelligence emerges
- Best for: Optimization and exploration tasks

#### Consensus Protocol
- Agents negotiate to reach agreement
- Multiple rounds of proposals
- Voting mechanisms for decisions
- Best for: Quality assurance and validation

### Agent Memory Architecture

```python
class AgentMemory:
    short_term: List[Dict]      # Current context (10 items)
    long_term: Dict[str, Any]   # Learned patterns
    episodic: List[Dict]        # Past experiences
    semantic: Dict[str, Any]    # Domain knowledge
    procedural: Dict[str, Any]  # How-to knowledge
```

### Self-Improvement Mechanisms

1. **Performance Tracking**
   - Success rate, completion time, quality scores
   - Resource efficiency, error rates
   - Learning curves for each task type

2. **A/B Testing Framework**
