# Agentic Architecture Documentation

## Overview

Certify Studio implements a truly autonomous multi-agent system where intelligent agents collaborate to create high-quality educational content. This document details the agentic architecture, agent types, and collaboration mechanisms.

## Core Agent Framework

### Autonomous Agent Base Class

All agents inherit from `AutonomousAgent` which provides:

- **BDI Architecture**: Belief-Desire-Intention model for autonomous decision making
- **Multi-Level Memory**: 
  - Short-term: Current task context (10 items max)
  - Long-term: Learned patterns and strategies
  - Episodic: Past experiences and outcomes
  - Semantic: Domain knowledge and concepts
  - Procedural: How-to knowledge and skills
- **Cognitive Cycle**: Perceive → Think → Plan → Act → Reflect
- **Self-Improvement**: Continuous learning from experience
- **Collaboration**: Ability to work with other agents

### Agent States

```python
class AgentState(Enum):
    IDLE = "idle"
    THINKING = "thinking"
    PLANNING = "planning"
    EXECUTING = "executing"
    REFLECTING = "reflecting"
    COLLABORATING = "collaborating"
    LEARNING = "learning"
    WAITING = "waiting"
    ERROR = "error"
```

### Agent Capabilities

```python
class AgentCapability(Enum):
    REASONING = "reasoning"
    PLANNING = "planning"
    LEARNING = "learning"
    VISION = "vision"
    AUDIO = "audio"
    GENERATION = "generation"
    EVALUATION = "evaluation"
    COLLABORATION = "collaboration"
    TEACHING = "teaching"
    OPTIMIZATION = "optimization"
```

## Reasoning Engine

The reasoning engine enables agents to:

### 1. Deductive Reasoning
- Apply inference rules to derive new facts
- Modus ponens, transitivity, and custom rules
- Build logical chains of reasoning

### 2. Inductive Reasoning
- Discover patterns in data
- Generalize from specific examples
- Identify common properties and relationships

### 3. Causal Reasoning
- Understand cause-effect relationships
- Predict outcomes of actions
- Use probabilistic causal models

### 4. Analogical Reasoning
- Transfer knowledge between domains
- Find structural similarities
- Apply successful patterns to new contexts

### 5. Pedagogical Reasoning
- Analyze cognitive load
- Identify prerequisites
- Design optimal learning sequences
- Generate educational recommendations

## Self-Improvement System

Each agent continuously improves through:

### Performance Tracking
```python
class PerformanceMetric(Enum):
    SUCCESS_RATE = "success_rate"
    COMPLETION_TIME = "completion_time"
    QUALITY_SCORE = "quality_score"
    RESOURCE_EFFICIENCY = "resource_efficiency"
    USER_SATISFACTION = "user_satisfaction"
    ERROR_RATE = "error_rate"
    LEARNING_RATE = "learning_rate"
```

### A/B Testing Framework
1. **Hypothesis Generation**: Identify improvement opportunities
2. **Experiment Design**: Create controlled tests
3. **Strategy Testing**: Compare different approaches
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Determine significant improvements
5. **Automatic Adoption**: Implement successful strategies

### Adaptive Behavior
- Parameter tuning based on performance
- Strategy selection using reinforcement learning
- Model retraining with new data
- Feedback incorporation from users and other agents

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

### Collaboration Protocols

#### 1. Hierarchical Protocol
```
Leader Agent
    ├── Plan Creation
    ├── Task Decomposition
    └── Result Aggregation

Follower Agents
    ├── Receive Subtasks
    ├── Execute Work
    └── Report Results
```

**Use Cases**: Well-structured tasks, clear delegation needs

#### 2. Peer-to-Peer Protocol
```
Agent A ←→ Shared Workspace ←→ Agent B
   ↓            ↓                ↓
Work Share   Coordination    Work Share
```

**Use Cases**: Creative tasks, equal contribution needed

#### 3. Blackboard Protocol
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Blackboard    │
│  (Problem Space)│
└────────┬────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────┬─────────┬──────────┐
    ↓         ↓         ↓          ↓
Agent A   Agent B   Agent C    Agent D
(opportunistic contribution)
```

**Use Cases**: Complex problems, exploratory solutions

#### 4. Contract Net Protocol
```
Task Announcement → Bid Collection → Winner Selection → Task Execution
```

**Use Cases**: Dynamic task allocation, resource optimization

#### 5. Swarm Protocol
```
Agents with simple rules → Emergent collective behavior
Pheromone trails → Indirect communication
Local interactions → Global optimization
```

**Use Cases**: Optimization problems, exploration tasks

#### 6. Consensus Protocol
```
Proposal Round 1 → Evaluation → Proposal Round 2 → ... → Consensus
```

**Use Cases**: Quality assurance, validation decisions

### Message Types

```python
class MessageType(Enum):
    INFORM = "inform"
    REQUEST = "request"
    PROPOSE = "propose"
    ACCEPT = "accept"
    REJECT = "reject"
    QUERY = "query"
    RESPONSE = "response"
    BROADCAST = "broadcast"
    NEGOTIATE = "negotiate"
    COMMIT = "commit"
    CANCEL = "cancel"
```

### Shared Workspaces

Agents can collaborate through shared workspaces that provide:
- Thread-safe data storage
- Lock mechanisms for resources
- History tracking
- Participant management

## Implementation Example

```python
# Initialize collaboration system

# Create specialized agents
domain_agent = DomainExtractionAgent(
    capabilities=[AgentCapability.VISION, AgentCapability.REASONING],
    llm=multimodal_llm
)

content_agent = ContentGenerationAgent(
    capabilities=[AgentCapability.GENERATION, AgentCapability.VISION],
    llm=multimodal_llm
)

pedagogy_agent = PedagogicalReasoningAgent(
    capabilities=[AgentCapability.TEACHING, AgentCapability.REASONING],
    llm=multimodal_llm
)

qa_agent = QualityAssuranceAgent(
    capabilities=[AgentCapability.EVALUATION, AgentCapability.REASONING],
    llm=multimodal_llm
)

# Register agents
for agent in [domain_agent, content_agent, pedagogy_agent, qa_agent]:
    collab_system.register_agent(agent)

# Create complex task
task = CollaborationTask(
    name="Generate Complete AWS VPC Module",
    description="Create educational content for AWS VPC certification",
    required_capabilities=["vision", "generation", "teaching", "evaluation"],
    priority=5
)

# Execute with hierarchical protocol
result = await collab_system.orchestrate_complex_task(
    task,
    protocol=CollaborationProtocol.HIERARCHICAL
)

# Agents self-improve based on results
for agent in [domain_agent, content_agent, pedagogy_agent, qa_agent]:
    performance = await agent.self_improvement.analyze_performance(result)
    
    if performance["improvement_hypotheses"]:
        experiments = await agent.self_improvement.experiment_with_strategies(
            performance["improvement_hypotheses"],
            task.name
        )
        
        await agent.self_improvement.adapt_behavior(
            experiments["best_strategies"],
            agent.config
        )
```
