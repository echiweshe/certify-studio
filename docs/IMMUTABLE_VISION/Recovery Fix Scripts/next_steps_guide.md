# CERTIFY STUDIO - NEXT STEPS GUIDE
## Your Sophisticated AI Agent Operating System is Ready! ðŸš€

### Current Status âœ…
- **Backend**: Running on `http://localhost:8000`
- **Frontend**: Running on `http://localhost:5173`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connected and working
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth operational (you're logged in as admin)
- **WebSocket**: Connected for real-time updates
- **Agents**: All 5 agents ready and waiting to work!

### Quick Actions for This Session

#### 1. Remove Mock Data (Optional)
The system is working, but shows some mock activity data. To remove it:

```bash
cd C:\ZBDuo_Share\Labs\src\BttlnsCldMCP\certify-studio-github-pull
python remove_mock_data.py
```

Then restart the server to see the changes.

#### 2. Test the Full Pipeline
The real magic happens when you upload a PDF and watch the agents work!

**Option A: Using the Web Interface**
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click "New Generation" or "Upload PDF"
3. Select a certification guide PDF
4. Configure options (duration, output formats)
5. Click "Generate"
6. Watch the real-time progress as agents work!

**Option B: Using the API Test Script**
```bash
cd C:\ZBDuo_Share\Labs\src\BttlnsCldMCP\certify-studio-github-pull
python test_generation.py
```

#### 3. Monitor Agent Activity
As generation runs, you'll see:
- **Domain Extraction Agent** parsing the PDF
- **Pedagogical Reasoning Agent** optimizing learning paths
- **Animation Choreography Agent** planning scenes
- **Diagram Generation Agent** creating visuals
- **Quality Assurance Agent** validating everything

### Troubleshooting

**If the server isn't running:**
```bash
cd C:\ZBDuo_Share\Labs\src\BttlnsCldMCP\certify-studio-github-pull
python -m certify_studio.main
```

**If you see import errors:**
```bash
pip install -e .
```

**If the frontend isn't loading:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Check logs:**
- Backend logs: Console where server is running
- Frontend logs: Browser developer console (F12)
