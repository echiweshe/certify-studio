## The Paradigm Shift

**From**: "How do we create content for AWS certifications?"
**To**: "How do we create content for ANY certification?"

**From**: Building specific features for each domain
**To**: Building universal capabilities that work everywhere

**From**: Months of manual work per certification
**To**: Minutes of automated generation

This is not incremental improvement.
This is complete transformation.
This is Certify Studio.
