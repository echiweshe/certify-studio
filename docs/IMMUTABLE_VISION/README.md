# IMMUTABLE VISION README

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: DO NOT MODIFY THESE DOCUMENTS

The documents in this directory represent the unchanging core vision and principles of Certify Studio. They serve as our North Star throughout development.

## üìÅ Contents

### 1. **MASTER_VISION.md**
The complete vision statement including:
- Core innovations (Domain Abstraction, Zero Configuration)
- Immutable principles
- Success metrics
- What we will NEVER compromise on

### 2. **TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md**
The complete system architecture showing:
- Domain abstraction pipeline
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Animation generation hierarchy
- Zero-configuration flow

### 3. **DOMAIN_ABSTRACTION.md**
Deep dive into our core innovation:
- How domain abstraction works
- Automatic hierarchy extraction
- Main flow + micro animation generation
- Real-world implications

### 4. **IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md**
Development guidelines ensuring we stay true to the vision:
- What to build first
- What to never build
- Success criteria for every feature
- Development manifesto

### 5. **MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.puml**
Visual UML diagram of the complete system architecture

### 6. **COMPLETE_EXAMPLE.md**
End-to-end example showing:
- What user provides (1 PDF)
- What system generates (complete course)
- Quality standards
- The paradigm shift

## üéØ Purpose

These documents exist to ensure that:

1. **We never lose sight of the revolutionary vision**
2. **Every feature aligns with core principles**
3. **We don't drift into building "just another tool"**
4. **Quality standards remain enterprise-grade**
5. **Automation remains complete (zero configuration)**

## üìè How to Use These Documents

### For Development Decisions
Before implementing any feature, ask:
- Does it align with the MASTER_VISION?
- Does it support Domain Abstraction?
- Does it maintain Zero Configuration?
- Does it generate BOTH main flows AND micro animations?
- Does it meet Enterprise Quality standards?

### For Architecture Reviews
- Compare implementations against TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE
- Ensure domain abstraction remains central
- Verify complete automation pipeline

### For Quality Checks
- Reference COMPLETE_EXAMPLE for output standards
- Ensure enterprise-grade quality
- Verify official provider assets used

## üö´ What These Documents Are NOT

- **Not suggestions** - They are requirements
- **Not guidelines** - They are rules
- **Not flexible** - They are immutable
- **Not optional** - They are mandatory

## ‚úÖ When to Reference

- **Every sprint planning**
- **Every architecture decision**
- **Every code review**
- **Every quality assessment**
- **When in doubt about direction**

## üí° Remember

We are not building a course creation tool.
We are building a complete course generation system.

We are not making content creation easier.
We are making content creation unnecessary.

We are not improving the process.
We are eliminating the process.
